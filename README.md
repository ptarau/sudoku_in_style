# Sudoku, in style

### Generic Sudoku solvers and generators in Python and Prolog, coded with elegance in mind

### Features:

- the same programs can be used to solve or generate or all puzzles
- it scales up from square  grids of size 4 and 9 grids up to grids of size 16
- it solves any easy or hard  Sudoku puzzle of size 9 in less than a second

Code is compact and elegant, with no dependencies.

Bypasses constraint solvers by transforming a Sudoku problem into a graph coloring problem, that it solves efficiently.

Recommended for introducing smart students to smart problem solving in Python and Prolog.
